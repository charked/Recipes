        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>1 large yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons finely chopped ginger (from a 1-in. piece)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons harissa</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 quarts vegetable broth</li>
        <li>2 cups cubed butternut squash</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups dried red lentils</li>
        <li>3 medium carrots, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (from 1 lemon)</li>
        <li>Chopped roasted almonds and chopped parsley, for serving</li>
        <li>Toasted pita and plain yogurt, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high. Add onion and garlic; cook, stirring often, until tender and beginning to brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Add ginger, harissa, spices, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant,
            about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add broth, squash, lentils, and carrots; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until lentils are tender, about 20 minutes. Working in 2 batches, transfer mixture to a blender. Remove center piece of blender lid to allow steam to
            escape. Secure lid on blender and place a clean towel over lid. Process until smooth, about 1 minute. (You can also use an immersion blender.) Return soup to pot and stir in lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Drizzle each serving with oil and top with almonds and parsley. Serve with toasted pita and yogurt for dipping.</li>
