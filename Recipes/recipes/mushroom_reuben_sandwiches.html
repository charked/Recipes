    <p>Hands on time: 25mins</p>
    <p>Total time: 40mins</p>
    <p>Servings: 4</p>
    <h3>Ingredients Needed</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 ounces mixed sliced fresh mushrooms, such as oyster, cremini, and shiitake (about 7 cups)</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 ½ teaspoons prepared horseradish</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup plus 3 Tbsp. mayonnaise, divided</li>
        <li>8 slices Jewish rye bread</li>
        <li>8 slices Swiss or provolone cheese (about 6 oz.)</li>
        <li>1 cup drained sauerkraut</li>
        <li>Persian (mini) cucumbers, halved lengthwise, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425°F with racks in upper and lower thirds. Divide mushrooms between 2 rimmed baking sheets. On each baking sheet, drizzle mushrooms with 2 tablespoons oil and season with ¼ teaspoon salt; toss to coat. Spread mushrooms in an even
            layer. Roast, rotating baking sheets halfway through, until mushrooms are golden and crispy in parts, 18 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, stir tomato paste, horseradish, soy sauce, ½ cup mayonnaise, and remaining ¼ teaspoon salt in a bowl until smooth.</li>
        <li>Spread 1 side of each bread slice with remaining 3 tablespoons mayonnaise. Flip and spread other sides of bread with tomato paste mixture (about 1 tablespoon per slice). Top each of 4 slices with 1 cheese slice, about ⅓ cup mushrooms, and ¼ cup
            sauerkraut. Top with remaining 4 cheese slices and 4 bread slices, mayonnaise sides facing up.</li>
        <li>Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium. Cook sandwiches in 2 batches, pressing gently with a spatula, until bread is golden and cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Serve with cucumbers.</li>
    </ol>
