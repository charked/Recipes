        <li>Preheat broiler with oven rack 8 inches from heat source. Place toasted rolls on a rimmed baking sheet. Spread ½ cup of the tomato sauce evenly inside rolls. Top with meatballs, remaining ½ cup tomato sauce, and cheese. Broil until cheese is melted
            and subs are warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes. Top with the torn basil.</li>
